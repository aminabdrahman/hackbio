# What cell types did you identify?

Adipocytes - fat cells
B cells - produce antibody
Dendritic cells - stimulating immune response
Eosinophils - a type of white blood cells
Fibroblasts - progenitors for specialised mesenchymal cell types
NK cells - lymphocytes that destroy infected and diseased cells
T cells - lymphocytes important for the adaptive immune system


# Is the tissue source really bone marrow?

No. The tissue is may be peripheral blood or samples from PBMC. There are a lot of hematologic cells. It is not bone marrow because no progenitor cells such as progenitor myeloids or lymphoids.

# Based on the relative abundance of cell types, is the patient healthy or infected?

I would assume the patient in infected with a pathogen. Based on the immune cells, there are a large concentration of cells from the addaptive immune system including NK, T, and B-cells which may suggest the patient has been sick for quite somewhile.
