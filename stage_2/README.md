# What cell types did you identify?

Adipocytes - fat cells
B cells - produce antibody
Bergmann glia - a type of specialised astrocytes
Dendritic cells - stimulating immune response
Eosinophils - a type of white blood cells
Fibroblasts - progenitors for specialised mesenchymal cell types
NK cells - lymphocytes that destroy infected and diseased cells
T cells - lymphocytes important for the adaptive immune system

# Is the tissue source really bone marrow?

No. First, the sample does not have any progenitor myeloid or lymphoid cells that is typically found in the bone marrow. Only blood cells to be found are mature blood cells. Second, the are cells specific to nervous system functions such as the Bergmann glia cells.

# Based on the relative abundance of cell types, is the patient healthy or infected?

I would assume the patient in infected with a pathogen. Based on the immune cells, there are a large concentration of cells from the addaptive immune system including NK, T, and B-cells which may suggest the patient has been sick for quite somewhile.
