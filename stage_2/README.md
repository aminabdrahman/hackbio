# What cell types did you identify?

Neutrophils - white blood cells that conducts phagocytosis.
B cells memory - specialized lymphocytes generated after the immune system's first encounter with a specific antigen. They reproduce highly specific secondary immune response upon re-exposure to the same antigen.
Platelets - important to stop bleeding by forming blood clots.
Nuocytes - act as first responders in a specific kind of immune defense called Type 2 immunity.
T cells - provide cell-mediated immunity by directly attack infected or cancerous cells and help regulate the overall immune response.
Plasma cells - specialised cells that produce antibodies.
Gamma delta T cells - unique and relatively small subset of T lymphocytes that operate at the intersection of the innate and adaptive immune systems, making them highly versatile first responders.
Monocytes - critical part of the innate immune system. They serve as the body's largest circulating defense cells, acting as sentinels, garbage collectors, and precursors to more specialized tissue-based immune cells.

# Is the tissue source really bone marrow?

No. The tissue is may be peripheral blood. There are a lot of hematologic cells. It is not bone marrow because no progenitor cells such as progenitor myeloids or lymphoids. There are many mature hematologic cells such as plasma cells which indicate that these cells are collection of cells that have mature out from the bone marrow.

# Based on the relative abundance of cell types, is the patient healthy or infected?

I would assume the patient in infected with a pathogen. Based on the immune cells, there are a large concentration of cells from the addaptive immune system including neutrophils, T, and B-cells which may suggest the patient has been sick for quite somewhile.
